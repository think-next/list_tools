- **Complete Statistics**: Display total number of grids in expansion
- **Batch Coordinates**: Provide complete vertex coordinates for all grids
- **One-Click Copy**: Easy export of all calculation results

#### üéØ Precise Geospatial Data Analysis
- **High-Precision Center Point**: Display grid center coordinates (6 decimal places)
- **Area Calculation**: Calculate actual geographic area (square meters) and equivalent circular radius
- **Edge Length Statistics**: Display longest and shortest edge lengths (in meters)
- **Radius Analysis**:
  - Vertex Radius: Longest/shortest distance from center to vertices
  - Edge-to-Center Radius: Longest/shortest distance from center to edge midpoints
- **Parent Cell Tracing**: View parent grid cell
- **Tooltips**: Hover to view detailed explanations for each metric

#### üìê Vertex Data Export

### Use Case Examples

#### Case 1: Map Application Development
"I need to verify which H3 grid a point on the map belongs to, and the coverage range of that grid. List Tools helped me quickly complete this calculation and provided detailed area and radius information."

#### Case 2: Delivery Route Optimization
"I'm planning delivery areas. Through the ring expansion feature, I can precisely calculate all grids within the service radius and understand coverage. Data supports one-click export, very convenient."

#### Case 3: Data Analysis Preprocessing
"When processing large amounts of geospatial data, I need to convert to H3 indexes first for classification. List Tools provides a professional tool, allowing me to focus on data analysis itself."

### Real-Time Help

- Provides clear English interface
